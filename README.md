# Analysis of security and privacy threats in the cloud, countermeasures adopted and how the blockchain can help

## Abstract 
The Cloud Computing paradigm is considered one of the most important paradigm shifts, in the technological field, in recent years. Its remarkable growth is mainly due to the opportunity it offers users to reduce costs and at the same time increase the efficiency of applications by providing a new approach to using services. In fact, one of the main features of the Cloud is the ability to pay only for the resources actually used and thus avoid large initial investments. However, despite the numerous advantages offered, there are still security issues that are perceived as the main obstacle to the massive adoption of the Cloud. In this study we analyze the main security and privacy threats in the Cloud, and the related countermeasures adopted to achieve a reliable Cloud environment. In particular, we will refer to the security mechanisms used by the most used Cloud Providers: Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Furthermore, a real case study of an attack on a Cloud Provider will be presented with the relative details to understand the level of associated risk, and finally we will make an overview on the use of the blockchain in combination with the Cloud to understand which added values ​​it manages to achieve.

## 2.Security and Privacy threats in the Cloud <a name="chap2"></a>
Although we have seen the potential advantages of the Cloud, its use or rather its adoption is often a source of doubts, especially in contexts where the data processed is particularly sensitive. The reason is that, in addition to the benefits, there are also security and privacy concerns that comes with the use of the Cloud. Below we analyze this type of problems.
